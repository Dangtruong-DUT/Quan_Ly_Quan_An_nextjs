## 📂 `app/api` Directory

This directory defines **API routes** for your Next.js application.

### ✅ Main Purpose

-   Each file or folder inside `app/api` represents a **dedicated HTTP API endpoint**.
-   Next.js automatically maps these files to **route handlers** under `/api`.
-   All incoming requests first pass through your **middleware** (if configured) before reaching these handlers.

### ⚙️ How It Works

-   **Dynamic routing** is supported. For example, `app/api/user/[id]/route.ts` maps to `/api/user/:id`.
-   You can export `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc., inside each `route.ts` to handle specific HTTP verbs.
-   You can use `Request` and `Response` objects, similar to native **Fetch API**.

### 🔑 Key Role

-   Handles **server-side logic**: authentication, database queries, CRUD operations, data validation, etc.
-   Bridges your **frontend** and your **backend services** securely.
-   Ensures sensitive operations run only on the server.

### 📌 Notes

-   Should **not contain any client-side code**.
-   Always implement proper **authorization checks** for sensitive endpoints.
-   Be cautious about what data you send in the response (no secrets!).

### 📁 Example Structure

```
app/
 ├─ api/
 │   ├─ auth/
 │   │   ├─ login/route.ts   → POST /api/auth/login
 │   │   ├─ logout/route.ts  → POST /api/auth/logout
 │   ├─ user/
 │   │   ├─ [id]/route.ts    → GET /api/user/:id
```

### ✅ Summary

The `app/api` folder acts as your **built-in server API** for your Next.js app. It works seamlessly with `middleware.ts` and other server-only logic.

Use it to write secure, isolated backend logic directly in your Next.js project.
